	"""
	Internal computation of the mean flow distance to outlets.

	This function calculates the average flow distance from each node to an outlet
	by traversing the topologically ordered nodes from downstream to upstream.

	Args:
		Stack (numpy.ndarray): A 1D NumPy array of topologically ordered node indices.
		Z (numpy.ndarray): A 1D NumPy array of topographic elevations (flattened grid).
		BCs (numpy.ndarray): A 1D NumPy array of boundary condition codes (flattened grid).
		D8 (bool): If True, uses D8 (eight-direction) flow routing; otherwise, uses D4 (four-direction).
		nx (int): Number of columns in the grid.
		ny (int): Number of rows in the grid.
		dx (float): Spatial step size.

	Returns:
		numpy.ndarray: A 1D NumPy array of mean flow distances from outlets.
